title: What We Do
---

We conduct formative research to identify opportunities for new technologies in Digital Financial Services. We look for ideas that address our challenge areas and with the potential for dramatic improvements in efficiency, speed, scalability, cost, security, and client value.
We then take these high potential ideas and prototype and fieldtest with mobile operator partners and banks.
Finally, we refine those technologies and work with our partners to transfer our technology into commercial applications.
